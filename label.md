# Policy Agent Pull request label check

Currently, we have `Pull request label check` workflow to Check that PR has a label for use in release notes. 
Pull requests require exactly one label from the allowed labels:

 1. 🚀 **Enhancements** `enhancement`: New feature or request
 2. 🐛 Bugs `bug`: Something isn't working
 3. 🧪 Tests `test`: Mark a PR as being about tests
 4. Uncategorized `exclude from release notes`: Use this label to exclude a PR from the release notes
